# module19_homework

It's the homework for Skillfactory course PHPPRO. The module is 19 (Working with advanced objects in JavaScript).

If you'd like to see tasks from lesson 19.3 and 19.4 separately, here you go:

- 19.3 - [ivan-developer-01/object-tasks-19.3](https://github.com/ivan-developer-01/object-tasks-19.3)
- 19.4 - [ivan-developer-01/oop-task-19.4](https://github.com/ivan-developer-01/oop-task-19.4)

The task files are named with the format

```none
task-<number>-<lesson>.js
```

where `<number>` is the task number (example: 4), while `<lesson>` is the lesson number (example: 19.4).

This format helps you easily find the necessary file without needing to look at every.
